Task 1 - Describe REST APIs and GIT
------------------------------------------------------

RESTful apis
whit a rest API its makes it easier to develop not only a webpage but apps as well whirt the information from the same system and the clients dosent have to be in the same langush, in most (if not all) programing langushes thare is a way to do a html request and get data  from an API whitch sends the respons in a way that the client program are abel to decode it to its own as a json string can be converted to a JS object or in PHP an assosiative array or a class. a RESTful API is not only able to use the GET request but all the metods as DELETE and POST to update information and delete information. 

------------------------------------------------------
GIT
Git is a version controll system that allows that you edit files and re commit them as a new version. whit GIT you can roolback to a previs version if the fix is more a bug then a fix. connected to something like github a group can work allong side each other and commit thers edits and merge them together. there are olso the posebility to branch of and build a ather part that while buildig whold conflit the other build.
